When is the last time you updated your website?

Not necessarily a full-blown redesign, just added some content. Maybe something that came up in a sales conversation. Or an answer to a common question you are asked.

If you can't remember, it's probably been too long.

_Why is that?_

Maybe you...
- Spend your time actually doing the work, and don't have time to add content to your website
- Find updating your website to be a painful, frustrating experience
- Aren't sure what content you should be adding to your site

If that sounds familiar, don't worry. You're in good company, because most business owners feel at least one of those burdens.

Let's talk about fixing that.

## I don't have time to update my site since I'm actually doing work



## Updating and adding content to my website is a crummy experience



## I'm not sure what I should be adding to my site
