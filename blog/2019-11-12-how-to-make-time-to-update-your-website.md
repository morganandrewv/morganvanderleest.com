Another year is coming to a close.

As you look back over the last year, how many times have you updated your website?

Do you remember the last time you updated it?

_If you had to open up your website to remember what it looked like, it's been too long._

## Why you should make time to update your website

The obvious reason is... if you don't, no one else will.

Especially if you run a solo company. And if that's the case, you'll have to make website updates more of a habit.

If your competitors aren't updating their websites, then they are eventually going to lose out to the business that does.

Buyers want to have as much information as they can get before making a purchasing decision. And they don't want to have to talk to someone to get that information.

The best way to deliver on that is to put as much as you can on your website.

## Every website update will have compound effects later

Every question you answer.

Every rock you overturn.

Every conversation you make easier by laying out the precursor on your website.

All of that will compound for your business.

You'll be able to refer to your website in sales conversations.

Think about that for a moment.

With a few hours of effort, you could save countless hours lost on unqualified leads and repetitive conversations.

## Tips to reduce the time you spend updating your website

### 1. Batch together updates you'd like to make

Keep a notebook or a running document of ideas you'd like to update. These can come from conversations you had with customers, feedback from your team, or inspiration from an unrelated source.

If you have a couple ideas jotted down, when you finally do make the time you won't be wondering what you should do.

### 2. Block out time specifically to add content and update your site

Rather than saying you'll "get to it", just block off time on your calendar and then *stick with it*.

I would recommend spending some time at least once per week. But even if you can only start with once per month, block it off and do it. As you reap the benefits, you'll start wanting to update your site more often.

### 3. Make sure you know exactly how to go about updating your site

Do you know how to add new pages, posts, or update content?

If not, that's something you should fix. Otherwise, you're going to keep putting this off.

Knowing how to update your website, even if it's just adding some text, is invaluable to the control you have over your business and its future.

### 4. Hire someone who is dedicated to updating your website

This doesn't replace the fact that you still need to be thinking about what to add to your site.

But having someone who knows what they are doing and is dedicated to your site can take a large burden off you.

You'll want to work in conjuction with them so the content and updates still align with your business and its goals. But now this person can handle the technical aspects of making new things appear on the internet.
